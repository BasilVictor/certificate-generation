# certificate-generation
This projects uses PHP to fetch data from a MySQL table containing participants details of a fest (multiple events) with their winning positions if any.

## Interface
The interface was made using HTML. It uses the Google Material Design css and js. Here the Event name and the type of certificate (Merit/Participation) is selected.

## Output
A PDF is generated with certificate text content which can be printed on a certificate printed template. It also has a QR Code which can be scanned to get an E-Certificate of the same.

### * Note *
The layout of the text was set by trial and error while keeping the certificate template as a background and changing the text positions.
